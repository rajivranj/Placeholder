Welcome to the \textbf{SDMX Constructor User Manual!}

SDMX Constructor\footnote{It was previously called DSD Constructor, it supported creating and editing Data Structure Definitions (DSDs) and their related artefacts (i.e., concept schemes and code lists). The significant improvements and additions to the software justify the name change of the tool from DSD Constructor to SDMX Constructor. With the latest update, the tool can now translate SDMX artefacts in multiple languages, integrate with the .Stat Suite, and manage reference metadata. Additionally, the tool now includes Table Modeller functionalities that make it easier for users who are new to SDMX to understand and use the software. The updated software is no longer just a DSD Constructor but a complete SDMX Constructor capable of handling various aspects of SDMX data and metadata. The new name better reflects the software's expanded capabilities, making it more relevant and recognizable to the target audience (\url{https://ilostat.github.io/dsdc/}).} is a powerful desktop software tool that helps users model aggregate data per the SDMX standards \footnote{An ISO standard (since 2005, version 2.1 since 2013): \url{https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/fr/\#iso:std:iso:17369:ed-1:v1:en} and \url{https://sdmx.org/?page_id=5008}} . It eases generating and editing SDMX artefacts and ultimately supports data availability and access through SDMX-compliant data portals (such as ones built with .Stat Suite\footnote{To learn more about the .Stat Suite platform please refer to the documentation here: \url{https://siscc.org/stat-suite/}. The SDMX Constructor has been optimised to seamlessly integrate with the .Stat Suite platform, as its back-end client.} ).

SDMX Constructor is one of the tools that comprise the ILO SDMX toolkit \footnote{\url{https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/sdmx-tools/}}, alongside SMART (Statistical Metadata-driven Analysis and Reporting Tool) and the SDMX Excel Add-in.

This user manual for the SDMX Constructor provides step-by-step instructions on using the tool in a user-friendly and accessible manner. It provides an in-depth understanding of SDMX Constructor's features and functionalities. It is an essential resource for anyone using the tool to manage and share data following the SDMX standards.

Below is a screenshot of the tool's landing page as an example of the user interface.

\hypertarget{audience-and-use-cases}{%
\section*{Audience and use cases}\label{audience-and-use-cases}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Audience and use cases}

The SDMX Constructor is designed to meet the needs of a wide range of users, from beginners who are new to SDMX to data managers who need advanced capabilities for managing large and complex datasets. In addition to these user types, there may be other groups of users with specific requirements or use cases. This user manual provides guidance and instructions for using the SDMX Constructor, focusing on the needs of these various user types.

\textbf{SDMX beginners}: These users are new to SDMX and want to use the SDMX Constructor to view, edit, and create new SDMX structural artefacts. They may need assistance understanding the SDMX concepts, terminology, and the software's user interface.

For SDMX beginners, this manual explains using the SDMX Constructor to access, view, edit, and create SDMX structural artefacts from SDMX registries. While one can find information on SDMX concepts and terminology from other sources, this manual focuses explicitly on the user interfaces of the SDMX Constructor. The SDMX beginners may be keen to know how to \protect\hyperlink{accessing-sdmx}{access SDMX artefacts from default SDMX registries} and \protect\hyperlink{connect-to}{connect to a new SDMX registry} from the SDMX Constructor.

\textbf{Data managers}: These users are likely familiar with the SDMX concepts and terminology and may require information about advanced functionalities offered by the SDMX Constructor. For example, they may want to use the SDMX Constructor as a backend client to manage SDMX artefacts for the .Stat Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM). For such cases, they may also use the SDMX Constructor to build the initial structural metadata when creating a new .Stat Suite instance.

There are several topics that data managers may be interested in learning when it comes to \protect\hyperlink{creating-sdmx}{creating SDMX artefacts from scratch}. Firstly, they may want to start by \protect\hyperlink{setting-up}{setting up a registry as a local folder}. Next, they can \protect\hyperlink{preparing-inputs}{prepare inputs} and create several artefacts, including the \protect\hyperlink{creating-agencyschme}{AgencyScheme}, \protect\hyperlink{creating-conceptscheme}{ConceptScheme, and Codelist} and the \protect\hyperlink{creating-dsd}{DSD, Dataflow, ContentConstraint, and CategoryScheme}. After creating these artefacts, they may want to learn how to \protect\hyperlink{upload-the}{upload the XML file to the Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)}. Additionally, they may want to know how to \protect\hyperlink{access-sdmx}{access SDMX artefacts from default SDMX registries} and \protect\hyperlink{connect-to}{connect to a new SDMX registry} for editing SDMX artefacts directly in the DLM.

\textbf{SDMX metadata managers}: These users manage SDMX artefacts and ensure their accuracy and consistency. They may use the SDMX Constructor to model data and modify SDMX structural artefacts, including translating SDMX artefacts in various languages, managing annotations and creating Metadata Structure Definition (MSD).

\hypertarget{scope-and-assumptions}{%
\section*{Scope and assumptions}\label{scope-and-assumptions}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Scope and assumptions}

This comprehensive manual provides a step-by-step guide on getting started with the software, including installing it and creating and managing SDMX artefacts. The manual includes a detailed overview of the tool's user interfaces, including menu items, navigation, and other essential features. The manual does not, however, delve into the intricacies of the SDMX standard itself. Describing the SDMX standard is beyond the scope of this manual, as it is an extensive and complex topic requiring more in-depth discussion and is available elsewhere. Instead, the manual assumes that readers are familiar with the SDMX standard and focuses on explaining how to use the tool within that context.

\hypertarget{benefits-of}{%
\chapter{Benefits of SDMX Constructor}\label{benefits-of}}

SDMX Constructor is a software tool that offers a range of features and functionalities designed to streamline and optimise the SDMX workflow, making it an essential tool for statistical organisations, data providers, and other stakeholders involved in the production and dissemination of statistical data.

One of the key benefits of SDMX Constructor is that it allows users to access and query SDMX structural artefacts from publicly available SDMX registries (through APIs in the background) in a desktop environment. This makes it easy for users to quickly and easily search for and view essential components of SDMX structural metadata, such as Data Structure Definitions (DSDs) and dataflows.

In addition to its API capabilities, SDMX Constructor offers two other essential features. The first is that it helps users model data following the SDMX standards. For example, SDMX Constructor makes it easy for users to define data structures and create data flows following SDMX standards. This is essential for data providers who need easy-to-use tools to ensure that their data can be shared and used by others in a consistent and standardised way.

The second essential feature of SDMX Constructor is that it enables users to create and edit SDMX artefacts in a user-friendly environment. This includes creating and editing code lists, concept schemes, DSDs, dataflows, content constraints, category schemes and Metadata Structure Definitions (MSDs). SDMX Constructor provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to create and modify these artefacts without needing to be an expert in SDMX.

Finally, SDMX Constructor supports data availability and access through online data portals. Using SDMX Constructor, data providers can ensure their data is available and accessible through online data portals built on SDMX standards. This allows data users to easily access and use the data they need for their research, analysis, and other activities.

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\chapter{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}}

Selecting (by double-clicking) an artefact from the left pane prompts its details to appear on the screen's right-side pane. This layout is available for Codelist, Dataflow and ContentConstraint.

For ConceptScheme, Table Modeller, DSD, AgencyScheme, CategoryScheme, and MSD, an additional pane also appears in the user interface (below the placeholder for listing the artefacts - (as heightened below)), which acts as a staging area (or a pool). It becomes a CONCEPTS POOL for ConceptScheme, Table Modeller, DSD and MSD options. And it turns into an AGENCY POOL for AgencyScheme and a CATEGORY POOL for CategoryScheme options.

The users can drag the artefacts back and forth between the pool area and the pane on the right.

\hypertarget{footnotes}{%
\section{Footnotes}\label{footnotes}}

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret \texttt{\^{}{[}{]}}. Like this one \footnote{This is a footnote.}.

\hypertarget{citations}{%
\section{Citations}\label{citations}}

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using \texttt{@key}.

For example, we are using the \textbf{bookdown} package \citep{R-bookdown} (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and \textbf{knitr} \citep{xie2015} (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib).
Note that the \texttt{.bib} files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML \texttt{bibliography} key.

The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: \url{https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/\#/citations}

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(thm:tri)}, for example, check out this smart theorem \ref{thm:tri}.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:tri}{}\label{thm:tri}For a right triangle, if \(c\) denotes the \emph{length} of the hypotenuse
and \(a\) and \(b\) denote the lengths of the \textbf{other} two sides, we have
\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]
\end{theorem}

By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you'd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a \texttt{\_404.Rmd} or \texttt{\_404.md} file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax.

\hypertarget{metadata-for-sharing}{%
\section{Metadata for sharing}\label{metadata-for-sharing}}

Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the \texttt{index.Rmd} YAML. To setup, set the \texttt{url} for your book and the path to your \texttt{cover-image} file. Your book's \texttt{title} and \texttt{description} are also used.

This \texttt{gitbook} uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same.

Specify your book's source repository on GitHub using the \texttt{edit} key under the configuration options in the \texttt{\_output.yml} file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter's source file.

Read more about the features of this output format here:
