Welcome to the \textbf{SDMX Constructor User Manual!}

SDMX Constructor\footnote{It was previously called DSD Constructor, it supported creating and editing Data Structure Definitions (DSDs) and their related artefacts (i.e., concept schemes and code lists). The significant improvements and additions to the software justify the name change of the tool from DSD Constructor to SDMX Constructor. With the latest update, the tool can now translate SDMX artefacts in multiple languages, integrate with the .Stat Suite, and manage reference metadata. Additionally, the tool now includes Table Modeller functionalities that make it easier for users who are new to SDMX to understand and use the software. The updated software is no longer just a DSD Constructor but a complete SDMX Constructor capable of handling various aspects of SDMX data and metadata. The new name better reflects the software's expanded capabilities, making it more relevant and recognizable to the target audience (\url{https://ilostat.github.io/dsdc/}).} is a powerful desktop software tool that helps users model aggregate data per the SDMX standards \footnote{An ISO standard (since 2005, version 2.1 since 2013): \url{https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/fr/\#iso:std:iso:17369:ed-1:v1:en} and \url{https://sdmx.org/?page_id=5008}} . It eases generating and editing SDMX artefacts and ultimately supports data availability and access through SDMX-compliant data portals (such as ones built with .Stat Suite\footnote{To learn more about the .Stat Suite platform please refer to the documentation here: \url{https://siscc.org/stat-suite/}. The SDMX Constructor has been optimised to seamlessly integrate with the .Stat Suite platform, as its back-end client.} ).

SDMX Constructor is one of the tools that comprise the ILO SDMX toolkit \footnote{\url{https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/sdmx-tools/}}, alongside SMART (Statistical Metadata-driven Analysis and Reporting Tool) and the SDMX Excel Add-in.

This user manual for the SDMX Constructor provides step-by-step instructions on using the tool in a user-friendly and accessible manner. It provides an in-depth understanding of SDMX Constructor's features and functionalities. It is an essential resource for anyone using the tool to manage and share data following the SDMX standards.

Below is a screenshot of the tool's landing page as an example of the user interface.

\hypertarget{audience-and-use-cases}{%
\section*{Audience and use cases}\label{audience-and-use-cases}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Audience and use cases}

The SDMX Constructor is designed to meet the needs of a wide range of users, from beginners who are new to SDMX to data managers who need advanced capabilities for managing large and complex datasets. In addition to these user types, there may be other groups of users with specific requirements or use cases. This user manual provides guidance and instructions for using the SDMX Constructor, focusing on the needs of these various user types.

\textbf{SDMX beginners}: These users are new to SDMX and want to use the SDMX Constructor to view, edit, and create new SDMX structural artefacts. They may need assistance understanding the SDMX concepts, terminology, and the software's user interface.

For SDMX beginners, this manual explains using the SDMX Constructor to access, view, edit, and create SDMX structural artefacts from SDMX registries. While one can find information on SDMX concepts and terminology from other sources, this manual focuses explicitly on the user interfaces of the SDMX Constructor. The SDMX beginners may be keen to know how to \protect\hyperlink{accessing-sdmx}{access SDMX artefacts from default SDMX registries} and \protect\hyperlink{connect-to}{connect to a new SDMX registry} from the SDMX Constructor.

\textbf{Data managers}: These users are likely familiar with the SDMX concepts and terminology and may require information about advanced functionalities offered by the SDMX Constructor. For example, they may want to use the SDMX Constructor as a backend client to manage SDMX artefacts for the .Stat Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM). For such cases, they may also use the SDMX Constructor to build the initial structural metadata when creating a new .Stat Suite instance.

There are several topics that data managers may be interested in learning when it comes to \protect\hyperlink{creating-sdmx}{creating SDMX artefacts from scratch}. Firstly, they may want to start by \protect\hyperlink{setting-up}{setting up a registry as a local folder}. Next, they can \protect\hyperlink{preparing-inputs}{prepare inputs} and create several artefacts, including the \protect\hyperlink{creating-agencyschme}{AgencyScheme}, \protect\hyperlink{creating-conceptscheme}{ConceptScheme, and Codelist} and the \protect\hyperlink{creating-dsd}{DSD, Dataflow, ContentConstraint, and CategoryScheme}. After creating these artefacts, they may want to learn how to \protect\hyperlink{upload-the}{upload the XML file to the Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)}. Additionally, they may want to know how to \protect\hyperlink{access-sdmx}{access SDMX artefacts from default SDMX registries} and \protect\hyperlink{connect-to}{connect to a new SDMX registry} for editing SDMX artefacts directly in the DLM.

\textbf{SDMX metadata managers}: These users manage SDMX artefacts and ensure their accuracy and consistency. They may use the SDMX Constructor to model data and modify SDMX structural artefacts, including translating SDMX artefacts in various languages, managing annotations and creating Metadata Structure Definition (MSD).

\hypertarget{scope-and-assumptions}{%
\section*{Scope and assumptions}\label{scope-and-assumptions}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Scope and assumptions}

This comprehensive manual provides a step-by-step guide on getting started with the software, including installing it and creating and managing SDMX artefacts. The manual includes a detailed overview of the tool's user interfaces, including menu items, navigation, and other essential features. The manual does not, however, delve into the intricacies of the SDMX standard itself. Describing the SDMX standard is beyond the scope of this manual, as it is an extensive and complex topic requiring more in-depth discussion and is available elsewhere. Instead, the manual assumes that readers are familiar with the SDMX standard and focuses on explaining how to use the tool within that context.

\hypertarget{benefits-of}{%
\chapter{Benefits of SDMX Constructor}\label{benefits-of}}

SDMX Constructor is a software tool that offers a range of features and functionalities designed to streamline and optimise the SDMX workflow, making it an essential tool for statistical organisations, data providers, and other stakeholders involved in the production and dissemination of statistical data.

One of the key benefits of SDMX Constructor is that it allows users to access and query SDMX structural artefacts from publicly available SDMX registries (through APIs in the background) in a desktop environment. This makes it easy for users to quickly and easily search for and view essential components of SDMX structural metadata, such as Data Structure Definitions (DSDs) and dataflows.

In addition to its API capabilities, SDMX Constructor offers two other essential features. The first is that it helps users model data following the SDMX standards. For example, SDMX Constructor makes it easy for users to define data structures and create data flows following SDMX standards. This is essential for data providers who need easy-to-use tools to ensure that their data can be shared and used by others in a consistent and standardised way.

The second essential feature of SDMX Constructor is that it enables users to create and edit SDMX artefacts in a user-friendly environment. This includes creating and editing code lists, concept schemes, DSDs, dataflows, content constraints, category schemes and Metadata Structure Definitions (MSDs). SDMX Constructor provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to create and modify these artefacts without needing to be an expert in SDMX.

Finally, SDMX Constructor supports data availability and access through online data portals. Using SDMX Constructor, data providers can ensure their data is available and accessible through online data portals built on SDMX standards. This allows data users to easily access and use the data they need for their research, analysis, and other activities.

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%

\hypertarget{working-area}{%
\subsection{Working area}\label{working-area}}

The following section explains the working area of the tool.

Below the menu items on top, the user interface appears divided into two main parts. First, the left pane on the interface serves as a space to hold the artefacts' list. The other side is designated to showcase relevant details (both sides are highlighted in different colours in the screenshot below). Selecting (by double-clicking) an artefact from the left pane prompts its details to appear on the screen's right-side pane. This layout is available for Codelist, Dataflow and ContentConstraint.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./images/image040} \end{center}

\href{images/image040.png}{Click here to enlarge the image}

For ConceptScheme, Table Modeller, DSD, AgencyScheme, CategoryScheme, and MSD, an additional pane also appears in the user interface (below the placeholder for listing the artefacts - (as highlighted below)), which acts as a staging area (or a pool). It becomes a CONCEPTS POOL for ConceptScheme, Table Modeller, DSD and MSD options. And it turns into an AGENCY POOL for AgencyScheme and a CATEGORY POOL for CategoryScheme options.

The users can drag the artefacts back and forth between the pool area and the pane on the right.

\hypertarget{input-and-output-methods}{%
\section{Input and output methods}\label{input-and-output-methods}}

Users can input information into SDMX Constructor in several ways, depending on the specific scenarios. The following are the options.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Typing and copy-pasting: Users can enter information by typing text or copying and pasting into fields in the forms using a keyboard.
\item
  Clicking: Users can interact with buttons, links, menus, or other graphical elements by clicking with a mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen. For example, double-clicking an artefact from the left pane load its details on the screen's right-side pane.
\item
  Dragging and dropping: Users can manipulate objects or select multiple items by dragging and dropping them with a mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen.
\item
  Loading from online SDMX Registry: Users can access pre-prepared SDMX artefacts from many default online SDMX registries. The input method allows users to retrieve information from the SDMX registry.
\end{itemize}

SDMX Constructor presents information to users in a standardised and user-friendly way, using a combination of graphical elements, form-based input and validation and error messages.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Graphical interface: The DSD Constructor uses a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the metadata components using visual elements like buttons, menus, and icons. This makes it easy for users to navigate and manipulate the metadata and get a quick overview of the SDMX artefacts.
\item
  Form-based input: The DSD Constructor uses form-based input screens to allow users to enter information about the metadata components. The forms are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear labels, dropdown menus, and text boxes that guide users through the input process.
\item
  Validation and error messages: The DSD Constructor validates the metadata components to ensure that they conform to the SDMX standard and are consistent with other components. If there are errors or inconsistencies, the tool provides error messages that help users identify and correct the issues.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{translation}{%
\section{Translation}\label{translation}}

DSD Constructor allows users to manage multilingual metadata components easily. Users can choose from automatic or manual translation methods and edit translations using translation tables. The tool simplifies the translation process with standardised language codes and automation and helps users achieve accurate, high-quality translations.

Here are some ways the tool can support the translation of SDMX artefacts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Translation into three languages: The tool supports translating content into three languages of your choice. It helps by following two automatic methods, but you can always do it manually if required.
\item
  Automatic translation methods: Using the Google Translate API key, you can connect with Google's translation services. Another automated way is using DeepL. The SDMX Constructor allows programmatic access to DeepL's machine translation technology, bringing high-quality translation capabilities directly to the tool.
\item
  Translation tables: Using these API keys, the SDMX Constructor provides translation tables, which allow users to edit suggested translations of metadata components in different languages. You can enter translations for different language codes, and the tool will automatically populate the translations in the appropriate fields.
\item
  Standardised language codes: The SDMX Constructor uses standardised language codes; users can select from a list of pre-defined language codes.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{using-sdmx}{%
\chapter{Using SDMX Constructor}\label{using-sdmx}}

Welcome to the chapter on using SDMX Constructor! This chapter will cover three key topics that will help you make the most of this powerful tool.

The first topic we will cover is how to use SDMX Constructor to access SDMX artefacts from SDMX registries. This will include step-by-step instructions on how to use the tool to connect to a registry, browse its contents, and download the artefacts you need.

Next, we will dive into how to use SDMX Constructor to create new SDMX artefacts from scratch. Whether you need to create a new concept scheme, code list or DSD, SDMX Constructor provides a simple and intuitive interface to help you get the job done.

Finally, we will explore how to use SDMX Constructor to work with .Stat Suite. This powerful platform is designed to help you analyse, visualise, and disseminate statistical data, and SDMX Constructor is the perfect complement to help you access and work with the SDMX artefacts you need.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of how to use SDMX Constructor to access, create, and work with SDMX artefacts, and you will be well on your way to becoming an expert in this powerful tool. So, let's get started!

\hypertarget{accessing-sdmx}{%
\section{Accessing SDMX artefacts from registries}\label{accessing-sdmx}}

In this section, we will walk you through the process of using SDMX Constructor on your computer to access and view the SDMX artefacts from the SDMX registries. This will enable you to easily browse and download the artefacts you need, for example, from the default registries already available in the SDMX Constructor.

\textbf{Default SDMX registries}

You can use the SDMX Constructor on your computer to access and view the SDMX artefacts from the SDMX registries. By default, SDMX Constructor offers the following registries to access SDMX artefacts: SDMX Global Registry: (\url{https://registry.sdmx.org/}), United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD): (\url{https://data.un.org/WS}), the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ESTAT) and the ILO Department of Statistics (ILOSTAT): (\url{https://www.ilo.org/sdmx/index.html}). You can view these by going to the Registry button and opening the Registry Name dropdown in the SDMX Registry tab, as shown below.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./images/image044} \end{center}

\href{images/image044.png}{Click here to enlarge the image}

As shown below, select a registry from the dropdown option to load the artefacts.

\hypertarget{setting-up}{%
\section{Setting up a registry as a local folder}\label{setting-up}}

You can use the SDMX Constructor to create SDMX artefacts on your computer without a complicated setup. You can start using it with a local folder on your computer. Following are the steps to set up a registry in a computer's local folder.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On your computer, create a folder, and let's call it LOCAL\_REGISTRY. The screenshot below shows that the folder is created within the C drive.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./images/image048} \end{center}

\href{images/image048.png}{Click here to enlarge the image}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Start the SDMX Constructor.
\item
  Click on the Registry button on the SDMX Constructor. It will open a pop-up window showing the default entries in the SDMX Registry tab.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./images/image050} \end{center}

\href{images/image050.png}{Click here to enlarge the image}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the pop-up window, there are only two fields where we need to make changes: Registry Name and Base URL. You can click the `New' button (which will clear the fields) or type directly within the fields.
\item
  For Registry Name, please type the name of the folder we created before LOCAL\_REGISTRY.
\item
  For the Base URL, get the path of the folder (shown below).
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./images/image052} \end{center}

\href{images/image052.png}{Click here to enlarge the image}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  After entries in two fields, the pop-up window will look like this:
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./images/image054} \end{center}

\href{images/image054.png}{Click here to enlarge the image}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{preparing-inputs}{%
\section{Preparing inputs}\label{preparing-inputs}}

To demonstrate the key functionalities of the SDMX Constructor, it is helpful to have a dummy dataset modelled appropriately.

Imagine a country called Demoland and its National Statistical Office (NSO), Demoland NSO. Imagine the Demoland NSO is creating SDMX artefacts for its data in the following two tables.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllllll@{}}
