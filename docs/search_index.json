SDMX Constructor is a powerful software tool allowing users to model aggregate data per SDMX standards1, generate and edit SDMX artefacts, and support data availability and access through online data portals. This user manual for the SDMX Constructor provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the tool in a user-friendly and accessible manner for various technical professionals, including data portals, database and IT infrastructure managers, developers, and statisticians. The manual provides an in-depth understanding of SDMX Constructor’s features and functionality. It is an essential resource for anyone using the tool to manage and share data following SDMX standards. Figure 0.1: A screenshot of SDMX Constructor Click here to enlarge the image Audience The primary target audience for this manual is data toolers, including data-portal, database and IT infrastructure managers, developers, and other technical professionals responsible for designing, building, and maintaining data systems. Another key audience for this manual is statisticians who manage regular and high-frequency data cycles. Statisticians often work closely with data toolers to ensure that data is collected, stored, and shared in a standardised and consistent manner. This manual provides statisticians with the knowledge they need to work effectively with SDMX.

The first purpose of SDMX Constructor is to help users model their data in accordance with SDMX standards. This is essential for data providers who need to ensure that their data can be shared and used by others in a consistent and standardized way. With SDMX Constructor, users can easily define data structures, create data flows, and specify data concepts, all in accordance with SDMX standards. The second purpose of SDMX Constructor is to enable users to generate and edit SDMX artefacts in a user-friendly environment. This includes creating and editing code lists, concept schemes, data structures, data flows and content constraints. SDMX Constructor provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to create and modify these artefacts without needing to be an expert in SDMX. Finally, SDMX Constructor supports data availability and access through online data portals. By using SDMX Constructor, data providers can ensure that their data is available and accessible through online data portals that are built on SDMX standards. This allows data users to easily access and use the data they need for their research, analysis, and other activities. 1.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. "],["cross.html", "Chapter 2 Cross-references 2.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 2.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 2 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 2.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 2.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 2.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Don’t miss Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(pressure, 10), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table! temperature pressure 0 0.0002 20 0.0012 40 0.0060 60 0.0300 80 0.0900 100 0.2700 120 0.7500 140 1.8500 160 4.2000 180 8.8000 "],["parts.html", "Chapter 3 Parts", " Chapter 3 Parts You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

Like this one 2. 4.2 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2023) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References "],["blocks.html", "Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations 5.2 Theorems and proofs 5.3 Callout blocks", " Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations Here is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (5.1). 5.2 Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 5.1.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
