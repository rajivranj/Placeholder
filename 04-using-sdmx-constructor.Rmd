## Footnotes

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.]. 

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). 
Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.


The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>
